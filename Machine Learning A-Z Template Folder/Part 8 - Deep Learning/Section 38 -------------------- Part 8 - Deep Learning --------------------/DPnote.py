# ================================= Part 8 ===================================
# Deep Learning
'''
Deep Learning is the most exciting and powerful branch of Machine Learning. Deep Learning models can be used for a variety of complex tasks:

    - Artificial Neural Networks for Regression and Classification
    - Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision
    - Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Analysis
    - Self Organizing Maps for Feature Extraction
    - Deep Boltzmann Machines for Recommendation Systems
    - Auto Encoders for Recommendation Systems

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Deep Learning models:
    - Artificial Neural Networks for a Business Problem
    - Convolutional Neural Networks for a Computer Vision task

# In this Section we'll learn:
    # The Nueron
    # The Activation Function
    # How do Nueral Networkd work?
    # How do Nueral Networks learn?
    # Gradient Descent
    # Stochastic Gradient Descent
    # Backpropagation

# The Nueron
    dendrite; axon
    
# The Activation Function
    1. Threshold Function:
        1 for x>0; 0 for x<0 (yes or no)
    2. Sigmoid Function:
        1/(1+e^(-x))
    3. Rectifier:
        max(x,0)
    4. Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh):
        (1-e^(-2x))/(1+e^(-2x))
